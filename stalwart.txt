[Stalwart](https://stalw.art/) is a mail server written in Rust.
Stalwart can be used for hosting [[email-address]] on an own server.

## Installation
How to install Stalwart can be found at their [documentation](https://stalw.art/docs/install/linux).
After running the installation script the only thing left to configure is the user accounts in the SQLite database.
How to add users can be found [here](https://stalw.art/docs/directory/types/sql).
After configuring everything restart the service using:
```sh
systemctl restart stalwart-mail
```

## Ports
For mail to work it is required to open ports that are used by mail protocols.
Services that rent servers usually disable mail ports by default.
It is most likely required to open a ticket to let support open those ports on an own server.
Following ports are required to be open to let Stalwart receive and send emails: 
```
443
465
993
587
25 
143
```

Open a port by executing the following `ufw` command:
```sh
ufw enable {port-number}
```

Repeat this command for every port listed above.

## DNS
Stalwart generates keys needed to add to the DNS configuration.

Key                   | Field | Value
----------------------|-------|-------------
`@`                   | `MX`  | `mx.th7mo.com.` (trailing dot `.`)
`stalwart._domainkey` | `TXT` | `{generated-DKIM1-key}` (including quotes)
`_dmarc`              | `TXT` | `{generated-DMARC1-key}` (including quotes) 
`@`                   | `TXT` | `{generated-spf1-key}` (something like `"v=spf1 a:mail.th7mo.com mx -all ra=postmaster"`)

## Add account to email client
### Gmail (mobile)
1. In the first screen `Add your email address` enter the email address.
2. When choosing which type of account this is, choose `Personal (IMAP)`.
3. Enter the password.
4. For `Incoming server settings`, adjust the `Server` from `th7mo.com` to `mail.th7mo.com`.
5. Also change the `Username` that defaults to the email address, to only the prefix.
   For example: when the email address is `thimo@th7mo.com`, make the `Username` only `thimo` (without the domain name).
6. Apply step 5 again for `Outgoing server settings`.
7. Now the account is set up, a `Account name` and `Your name` can be chosen (optional).

### Manual setup 
This configuration is for other mail clients.
It is possible that not every listed setting is required by the chosen mail client.
The individual setting names can vary too.

#### Incoming server settings (IMAP)
* **Username**: email address without domain (`thimo` for `thimo@th7mo.com`)
* **Server**: `mail.th7mo.com`
* **Port**: `993`
* **Connection security**: `SSL/TLS`
* **Authentication method**: `normal password`

#### Outgoing server settings (SMTP)
* **Username**: email address without domain (`thimo` for `thimo@th7mo.com`)
* **Server**: `mail.th7mo.com`
* **Port**: `465`
* **Connection security**: `SSL/TLS`
