When something is atomic, it cannot be broken into smaller pieces. Atomic things
only have a [single responsibility](single-responsibilty-principe). Atoms are
the smallest unit of matter and cannot be further divided.

A book that uses this terminology is [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).
