[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is a utility that simplifies
the process of making [symbolic links](symbolic-link). It can be
used to easily manage [dotfiles](dotfiles).

## Installation
Install Stow by executing the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install stow
```

## Usage
Mirror what the [home directory](home-directory) structure should
be exactly inside the `~/dotfiles/` directory, because Stow will make
symbolic links in directories following the same hierarchy. The name of
the Stow directory can be anything, but here the name `dotfiles` will be
used.

For example: [Helix](helix) wants a `config.toml` file located at
`~/.config/helix/config.toml`. If the `config.toml` file is located at
`~/dotfiles/.config/helix/config.toml`, Stow will create a symbolic link
to where Helix wants to read the configuration file.

To create symbolic links for all the files in the `~/dotfiles/`
directory to the home directory, execute the following command:

```sh
stow ~/dotfiles/
```

Or in the repository **at root level**:

```sh
stow .
```

Be careful with where to execute Stow commands. Only execute `stow .`
**at the root** of the repository, otherwise the symbolic links will be
incorrect. Also be careful when removing symbolic links and make sure to
have a backup of the original configuration files (dotfiles).
