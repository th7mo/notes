Files prefixed with a dot `.` are called dotfiles. They are hidden by default
on [Unix](unix)-based operating systems. Dotfiles are used to store any type of
configuration. All the user configuration is stored in dotfiles somewhere in or
under the [home directory](home-directory). A lot of applications store their
configuration in the `~/.config/` directory.

It is recommended to make a [Git](git) repository to back up and sync
configuration files. However, it is not recommended to make a Git repository
directly in the home directory. A better alternative is to move configuration
files into a separate directory like `~/dotfiles/`. To make sure installed
programs still have access to the configuration files, [symbolic-links]
(symbolic-link) to the configuration files can be made using [Stow](stow).

## History
That dotfiles are invisible was an accident[^1]. A long time ago Unix decided
to hide the `.` and `..` directories because they exist in every directory. They
only checked if the first character of a file or directory name was a dot `.`,
and hid it when that was the case:

```go
if fileName[0] == "." {
    hideFile()
}
```

[^1]: [Rob Pike on the Origin of Unix Dot File Names](http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/writ/unix_origin_of_dot_filename.html)

This results in every file and directory starting with a dot to be hidden.
What they should have done is check if the filename is `.` or `..` instead:

```go
if fileName == "." || fileName == ".." {
    hideFile()
}
```
