[GitHub](https://github.com) allows for a special repository. The name of the
repository needs to be the same as the username. For me this repository is
[`th7mo/th7mo`](https://github.com/th7mo/th7mo). The `README.{md|txt|adoc}` of
this repository will be shown on a users profile. This profile README repository
needs to be public.

See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) for more information about profile README's.
