[GitHub](https://github.com) allows for a special repository. The name of the
repository needs to be the same as the username. For me this repository is
`th7mo/th7mo`. The `README.{md|txt|adoc}` of this repository will be shown on a
users profile. This profile README repository needs to be public[^1].

[^1]: See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) for more information about profile README's.
