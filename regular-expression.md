A regular expression (or regex) is a match pattern. They allow searching large
amounts of text or making sure strings meet specific criteria. This is useful
for checking if passwords contain lowercase, uppercase, and a few special
characters. It can also be used to validate if a string is a valid email
address.

Regular expressions are one of the few exceptions for commenting code. This is
because it can be difficult to understand a regular expression.

A regular expression can have special characters that have a special meaning.
The backslash `\` is used to escape a special character.
