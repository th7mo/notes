Plain text is a file format readable for everyone[^1]. Examples of those formats
are [Markdown](markdown), [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) or just `.txt`
files. Every operating system can read text files without installing additional
software. File formats used by Microsoft Word, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
or [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) are
proprietary and unreadable without their software. This makes it hard to migrate
to another solution.

[^1]: With 'plain text' I also include lightweight markup languages using ASCII.

Another benefit for using plain text is the flawless cooperation with [Git](git)
This allows for easy collaboration and storing history for every project that
uses plain text file formats.
