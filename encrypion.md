Amount of keys:

* 1 key makes encryption symmetric
* 2 keys make encryption asymmetric (RSA)

Symmetric encryption is generally faster and good for encryption large amounts
of information quickly. It is also easier to use, but less secure. Asymmetric
encryption is a slower but safer option because when a key is compromised the
data is still safe.
