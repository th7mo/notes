Paragraphs should be in between 50 and 70 characters of width[^1]. Too wide
paragraphs will make readers take big horizontal movements when starting a new
line. Too small paragraphs break the flow of reading text.

[^1]: According to the [Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability).

When working with [CSS](css) the `ch` unit can be used to achieve this. The `ch`
unit [is defined as](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-3/#ch):

> "Equal to the used advance measure of the "0" (ZERO, U+0030) glyph
> found in the font used to render it."

In proportional typefaces, `1ch` is *usually* around 20% wider than the average
character width[^2]. This makes the optimal paragraph width in CSS between
`40ch` and `60ch`:

```css
p {
    max-width: 55ch;
}
```

Fonts can however vary in their width. It is best to experiment width the value
on each font to determine the best paragraph width. Be careful with using the
`ch` unit when using system fonts (`system-ui`). Because different operating
systems have different system fonts the width is not consistent across all
devices.
