A [Git](git) rebase adds one or multiple [commits](commit) from a
[branch](branch) on top of another branch.

The most simple use case for a rebase is when a [remote](remote) branch somebody
is also locally working on has new changes. First, fetch the remote to download
contents from the remote repository:

```sh
git fetch
```

If new changes have been made to the remote branch, include those remote changes
by rebasing the commit made on top of the local branch as if they were made
locally:

```sh
git rebase origin main
```

Now all the new commits made on the remote `origin/main` branch will be applied
to the local `main` branch.

A shorthand for this workflow is the `pull` command with the `--rebase` flag:

```sh
git pull [--rebase] <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

The `--rebase` flag can be omitted when the `pull.rebase` option is configured
in the [gitconfig](gitconfig):

```ini
[pull]
    rebase = true
```
