The [[second-brain]] does not feel right.
I want this project to be big and neat.
This [[note]] is like a drawing board where I plan the future of the Second Brain.

## Vision
* This project must be tracked by [[Git]] and must preserve its history.
* This project must be portable.
* This project must be English.
* This project must be designed with great compatibility and future-proofing.
* This project must be minimalistic in nature.
* This project must be easy to maintain and improve.
* This project must reflect me and have the same strengths.
* This project should have a website.
* This project should be shareable with anyone.
* This project should be DRY (It needs to have a single version of the truth like variables or functions).
* This project could protect private parts that won't be publicly available.

## Clarify
* What ways can I edit this project?
  ANSWER: HTML so whatever you like
* Jargon: How to name this project and its parts (now second brain and notes).
  ANSWER: Digital Garden, find out the rest.
* How do I keep it simple?
  Use a markup language
* How to deploy/convert to a website
  ANSWER: Just make a website
* Which format for storing while preserving portability? 
  * Markdown
  * WikiText
  * Plain HTML with a global stylesheet targeting HTML tags? !THIS ONE
  * A programming language
  * Flavoured Markdown
  * Other markup language?
* Can I pull off only using plain text to keep the Git history small?
  ANSWER: You should.
* Should I allow emojis?
  ANSWER: If they are only an enhancement and not a dependency, yes.
* How to make it something special for a CV?
  You don't

## Things learned
I could treat this as a 'regular' website.
The World Wide Web is not going anywhere anytime soon, and using plain HTML is still readable and easy to edit.
It is also more portable than Markdown.
It has more standardization behind it than Markdown does.
HTML could always be converted back to Markdown.
I could use a Frontend Framework to make it exactly how I want the content to look, and keep everything inside a single repostitory.
Everything that was a note, is now a page on the website.
Wrap the HTML in custom elements, so it can be modified however I like (you never know).
