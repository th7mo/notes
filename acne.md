The most important things you need to focus on when trying to reduce acne are:

* Eating whole foods
* Sleeping well
* Keeping your face clean
* ***Not touching your face!***

Other than that there are chemicals that can help:

* Benzoyl peroxide in the evening for reducing skin sebum production
    * Be careful and avoid contact with clothing
* Clindamycin in the morning for reducing bacteria
