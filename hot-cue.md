In [Rekordbox](rekordbox) Hot Cues are used to skip to a specific part of a
track. With the Quantize feature enabled, Hot Cues will only trigger when the
track reaches the next bar. Place the most essential Hot Cues in slots A, B, and
C, as older DJ equipment typically only had three Hot Cue slots.
