There are two forms of meditation[^1]:

1. Distracting our conscious mind.
   This can be done by focusing on the breath,
   listening to a mantra or a guided meditation session.
2. Actively engaging to the present moment.
   This can be done by listening to our surroundings,
   feeling the comfort and uncomfort of our bodies,
   and allowing thoughts to pass through our minds.

Try to stand, sit or lay a position that is comfortable.
It helps to close your eyes while meditating.
It limits the amount of distractions and allows
our bodies to be more concentrated on other senses.

Some people meditate for multiple hours a day,
but I experience that 10 minutes a day can
make a huge impact on mental clarity.
