A wikilink is a [bidirectional link](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals)
from one article to another article. [Obsidian](obsidian) and
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) use wikilinks to link their resources to
each other.

## Link to an article
A wikilink is created by enclosing the name of an article by double square
brackets:

```md
[[{name-of-article}]]
```

Only the first character of the wikilink name is *case-insensitive*. This allows
for proper capitalizing the first character of a sentence. It also allows to
properly capitalize wikilinks when the link text represents something that
should be capitalized by default.

## Link to an article heading
To link to a heading in another article, append a `#` and the heading name to
the article name:

```md
[[{name-of-article}#{name-of-heading}]]
```

The name of the heading is *case-sensitive*.

To link to a heading in the same article, emit the name of the article:

```md
[[#Link to a article heading]]
```

## Amount of wikilinks
A wikilink for an article should appear only *once* in an article. It is allowed
however to have multiple wikilinks to the same article if the wikilinks link to
different headings. This makes the article more readable and makes for a simple
rule to follow. It is also easier to write, especially in technical articles
where there can be a lot of mentions of other articles.

A wikilink should be placed at the first mention of the concept it will link to.

## Compatibility
Wikilinks are not part of the official [Markdown](markdown) specification. They
are also not well-supported either. However, they are more pleasant to read,
write and maintain than regular Markdown links. There are tools available that
convert wikilinks into regular Markdown links.
