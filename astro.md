[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a frontend framework for content-driven
websites. Astro primarily supports content written in [Markdown](markdown).
Additional metadata about the content is provided in
[YAML front matter](yaml-front-matter). The philosophy of Astro is opting
in for JavaScript only when it's needed. Astro in its most simple setup is
a static site generator like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Without JavaScript, Astro only generates HTML
and [CSS](css) files.

The most popular method to create a new Astro project is with `npm`:

```sh
npm create astro@latest
```

The `scripts` object inside the `package.json` file shows how to run, build and
preview the Astro project.

## Project structure
* `src/pages/`: All the pages of the website.
* `src/layouts/`: Astro templates.
* `src/content/`: Content collections (like blogs or articles).
* `src/components/`: Reusable frontend components.
* `src/styles/`: Local CSS files.
* `public/`: Static assets (favicons, images and fonts).
* `dist/`: Compiled Astro project.

## Footnotes
Astro converts [footnotes](footnote) written in Markdown to HTML links displayed
in a superscript. The references for footnotes have classes that are prefixed
with `user-content-fn`. The actual footnotes are listed at the end of the
generated HTML file under a level 2 [heading](markdown#headings) named
'Footnotes'. The classes for the footnotes themselves are prefixed with
`user-content-fnref`. This allows for custom styling of both the footnotes and
their references:

```css
/* Only target footnote reference */
a[href^="user-content-fn"]:not(href^="user-content-fnref") {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```
