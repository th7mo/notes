A symbolic link, often called a 'symlink', is a file that serves as a reference/
pointer to another file or directory.

With [Unix](unix)-based systems the `ln` (link) command with the `-s` (soft)
flag can be used to create symbolic link:

```sh
ln -s {target_path} {link_path}
```

* `{target_path}` is the path to the file or directory to link to.
* `{link_path}` the desired path for the (new) symbolic link.
