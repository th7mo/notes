It is possible to revert changes without modifying the [Git](git) history.
This makes reverting [commits](commit) a safer option than [resetting](reset)
commits. To revert a commit execute the following command:

```sh
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Unlike `git reset`, the `git revert` command only reverts the changes of a
specified commit, and will not revert the commit that came after the specified
commit.

The `git revert` command also accepts a range of commits:

```sh
git revert [--no-commit] <commit-hash>..HEAD
```

```sh
git commit -m "revert: <reason-for-reverting>"
```

The `git revert` command above reverts all changes from the `<commit-hash>` up
to and including where `HEAD` is. It also adds the files that have reverts to
the [staging area](staging-area). For more safety use the `--no-commit` flag.
It allows for reviewing the reverted changes before the commit is made. To abort
the revert execute:

```sh
git revert --abort
```
