[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note-taking program. Notes created in
Obsidian use the [Markdown](markdown) format. The Obsidian way of note-taking
stimulates to link notes together and keep notes [atomic](atomic); a single
topic/concept per note. The default way to link notes is using
[wikilinks](wikilink). It is also possible to configure Obsidian to use regular
Markdown links.

A project inside Obsidian is called a vault. A vault is just a directory inside
a file system. Obsidian stores all its data in the hidden `.obsidian/` directory
inside the vault.

Obsidian has a graph view that shows all notes inside a vault and the
connections between them. The graph view can be used to overview notes, and see
the coherence of the notes in a single view. The graph view shows non-existing
notes in a light-gray color.

The Obsidian community maintains a large collection of plugins that enhance
Obsidian. This is done by introducing new syntax in the Markdown files. The
downside of Obsidian plugins is that it defeats the portability aspect of
Obsidian because the Markdown files become littered with unofficial Markdown
that can't be easily ported to other programs anymore.
