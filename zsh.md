The Z shell, also known as Zsh, is a Unix shell that is similar to [Bash](bash)
or [Fish](https://fishshell.com/). It is built upon the Bourne Shell (sh) and
Bash, and provides additional features compared to those shells.
[Oh My Zsh](oh-my-zsh) is a commonly used framework that can be used with Zsh.

## Installation
Zsh can be installed with `apt`:

```sh
sudo apt install zsh
```

Set Zsh as the default shell with the `chsh` (change shell) command:

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

`$(which zsh)` evaluates to the path where Zsh is located. On most systems this
path will be `/usr/bin/zsh`.

## Configuration
Z shell is configured via the `.zshrc` file. It is recommended to put the
`.zshrc` file inside the [dotfiles](dotfiles) repository to keep configuration
backed up.
